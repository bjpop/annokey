NCBI Gene Downloading Tool


This program downloads gene database file that is binary and compressed from NCBI ftp server, and converts file to xml. 
 - NCBI ftp server address: ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov

The gene database to be downloaded and converted is determined by the option argument (--species). The users must pass the full file path and name. 
 - Default database path: /gene/DATA/ASN_BINARY/Mammalia/Homo_sapiens.ags.gz

Downloading gene file:
Before downloading data file from the server, it checks the last modified time of the database. If the local directory (where the program is executed) has the same version, downloading does not executed. If the local directory has not the latest version, it downloads. 
However, by passing optional argument (--force), the database file would be downloaded and converted without regarding the file in local directory.

Converting gene file to xml:
Using linux.gene2xml

By passing optional arguments, the users can make this progrom either donwload database only or convert database only.


Options
	
        [-h] [--verbose VERBOSE] [--force] [--species SPECIES]
        [--downloadonly] [--convertonly GENEFILE]

        --verbose: Prints progress messages. The level of detail of the message could be adjustable by passing arguments. The levels are 0, 30, 60, and 100. The default level is 60.
                   Level 0: Prints out nothing except error message.
                   Level 30: Prints out the brief status of the progress.
                   Level 60: Prints out the detail of the progress.
                   Level 100: Same with Level 60 but displays callstack when error occurs.

                error msg  | brief status | detail status | callstack

        e.g) --verbose=60
        Starts conneting to server (ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).
          >> Connecting to server is successful.
        Starts getting the last modified time of data.
          >> Getting the last modified time of data is successful.
          >> The last modified time of the data at the server is 20130106185643
        Starts downoloading data from server.
          >> The file size is 135M
          >> Downloading...         10.34% 
         
       --force: Downloads database file without regarding the file in the local directory. If there is the same version in local directory, this file would be overwritten.       
        e.g) --verbose=60 --force

      --species: The path of database file on the ftp server.
        e.g) --species=/gene/DATA/ASN_BINARY/Mammalia/Canis_familiaries.ags.gz

      --downloadonly: If the users want to download the database file but not convert it to xml. 
        e.g) --verbose=60 --force --downloadonly
 
      --convertonly: If the users want to convert the database file in the local directory. 
        e.g) --convertonly=Homo_sapiens_20130106185643.ags.gz



Output
	Two files would be stored when the program is finished successfully. If either --downloadonly or --convertonly is passed, only one of the two file would be stored.

1.	{gene databse name}_{last modifited time}.ags.gz 
2.	{gene databse name}_{last modified time}.xgs

The format of last modified time is yyyymmddhhmmss. Note that the last modified time is the server’s time.

    e.g) For /gene/DATA/ASN_BINARY/Mammalia/Homo_sapiens.ags.gz
         Homo_sapiens_20130106185643.ags.gz
         Homo_sapiens_20130106185643.xgs


Performance 

1. Time elapsed for downloading gene binary file: 660 secs (varies depending on network/server status)
2. Time elapsed for converting file: 120 secs

•	performed on merri
•	binary file size : 136M
•	xml file size: 8.3G


Remarks: Verified that the output xml file correctly works for ‘NCBI Gene Search Tool ’.
