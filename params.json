{"name":"Annokey","tagline":"Annotation of gene lists with keyword hits from the NCBI gene database and PubMed abstracts","body":"### Introduction\r\nAnnokey is a tool for annotating gene lists with the results of a keyword search of the NCBI gene database and linked Pubmed article information. Its purpose is to help users prioritise genetic mutations ordered by relevance to a domain of interest, such as \"breast cancer\" or \"DNA repair pathways\" etcetera. The user steers the search by specifying a ranked list of keywords and phrases that are likely to be highly correlated with their domain of interest.\r\n\r\nAnnokey's main inputs are:\r\n1. A CSV file representing your set of genes, one gene per row.\r\n2. A list of search terms sorted in descending order of priority.\r\n\r\nAnnokey's main output is a new CSV file representing an annotated version of the input CSV file. Each row of the CSV file (representing a given gene) is given an extra column containing information about which search terms matched that gene in NCBI and PubMed abstracts.\r\n\r\nFor example, if your input gene CSV file contains the following rows:\r\n\r\n    Gene\r\n    XRCC2\r\n    PALB2\r\n    BRCA1\r\n\r\nand your input search term file contains the following lines:\r\n\r\n    DNA repair\r\n    breast cancer\r\n\r\nthe output CSV file produced by Annokey will look like this:\r\n\r\n    Gene\r\n    XRCC2\r\n    PALB2\r\n    BRCA1\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\n### How to run Annokey\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
