{"name":"Annokey","tagline":"Annotation of gene lists with keyword hits from the NCBI gene database and PubMed abstracts","body":"### Introduction\r\nAnnokey is a tool for annotating gene lists with the results of a keyword search of the NCBI gene database and linked Pubmed article information. Its purpose is to help users prioritise genetic mutations ordered by relevance to a domain of interest, such as \"breast cancer\" or \"DNA repair pathways\" etcetera. The user steers the search by specifying a ranked list of keywords and phrases that are likely to be highly correlated with their domain of interest.\r\n\r\nAnnokey's main inputs are:\r\n\r\n1. A CSV file representing your set of genes, one gene per row.\r\n2. A list of search terms sorted in descending order of priority.\r\n\r\nAnnokey's main output is a new CSV file representing an annotated version of the input CSV file. Each row of the CSV file (representing a given gene) is given an extra column containing information about which search terms matched that gene in NCBI and PubMed abstracts.\r\n\r\nFor example, if your input gene CSV file contains the following rows:\r\n\r\n    Gene\r\n    XRCC2\r\n    PALB2\r\n    BRCA1\r\n\r\nand your input search term file contains the following lines:\r\n\r\n    DNA repair\r\n    breast cancer\r\n\r\nthe output CSV file produced by Annokey will look like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nGene,Annokey_annotation\r\nXRCC2,\"(kw: DNA repair, rank: 1, ncbi id: 7516, fields: Process;Alternative Name;PMID(106/181))\",\"(kw: breast cancer, rank: 2, ncbi id: 7516, fields: GeneRIFs(8/33);PMID(53/181))\"\r\nPALB2,\"(kw: DNA repair, rank: 1, ncbi id: 79728, fields: GeneRIFs(2/77);Process;PMID(34/189))\",\"(kw: breast cancer, rank: 2, ncbi id: 79728, fields: GeneRIFs(37/77);Summary;PMID(147/189))\"\r\nBRCA1,\"(kw: DNA repair, rank: 1, ncbi id: 672, fields: GeneRIFs(27/1258);Summary;Process;PMID(380/3659))\",\"(kw: breast cancer, rank: 2, ncbi id: 672, fields: GeneRIFs(334/1258);Summary;Description;Alternative Name;PMID(2268/3659))\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see the output contains a lot of detail about each search term match. Consider the first case for XRCC2:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\"(kw: DNA repair, rank: 1, ncbi id: 7516, fields: Process;Alternative Name;PMID(106/181))\",\"(kw: breast cancer, rank: 2, ncbi id: 7516, fields: GeneRIFs(8/33);PMID(53/181))\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis annotation contains two entries, one each for the search terms \"DNA repair\" and \"breast cancer\". The entry for \"DNA repair\" says that the search term had rank 1 (it was the first entry in the file of search terms), the gene record for XRCC2 was found in the NCBI database record with ID 7516, and the search term was found in three places: \"Process\", \"Alternative Name\" and PMID(106/181)\".\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nThe best way to install Annokey is to use the following command:\r\n\r\n    pip install git+https://github.com/bjpop/annokey.git\r\n\r\nThis will automatically download and install the dependencies of Annokey.\r\n\r\n### How to run Annokey\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
